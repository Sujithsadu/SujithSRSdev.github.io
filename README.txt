Sujith Reddy Sadu - Java Full Stack Developer Portfolio

👨‍💻 Professional Introduction

Hi, I'm Sujith Reddy Sadu.

I am a results-driven Java Full Stack Developer with over 4+ years of professional experience designing and developing scalable, high-performance web applications. My expertise lies in bridging the gap between complex back-end logic and intuitive front-end interfaces.

I specialize in building robust solutions using Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate, Angular, and React. My background includes working with major corporations like The Vanguard Group, Cencora, and Cognizant, where I successfully delivered microservices-based architectures and cloud-native applications on AWS and Azure.

I am passionate about Cloud Computing, DevOps automation (Docker/Kubernetes), and integrating Machine Learning models into practical software solutions.
